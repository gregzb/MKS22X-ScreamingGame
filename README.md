# Screaming Game
  This project appears to be a normal platformer at first glance, but comes with the twist that rather than using the keyboard to control the character, sound from the microphone is used instead.
  
## How To Run It
  Open up the project in Processing, press the play button and use A, D, and space to move around.
  (Only tested in Processing version 3.5.3)
